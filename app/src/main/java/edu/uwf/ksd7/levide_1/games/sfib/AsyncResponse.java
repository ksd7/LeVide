 * The following interface is used in a class that instantiates an AsyncTask

 * it implements this particular interface.  This requires that it create an
 * processFinish() method.  When the AsyncTask has completed and calls onPostExecute(),
 * processing results can be passed backed to the class that instantiated the AsyncTask.
 * Setting of a "delegate" variable is necessary so that the AsyncTask knows how to
 * get the results back to the instantiator class.
