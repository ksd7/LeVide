<h3>About LeVide</h3>
LeVide is an educational game for foreign language learning that is made up of game modules that are accessed from the Game Menu screen.  To reach the Game Menu screen, a player may either login with valid Google credentials or login as a guest.  Guest login results in game statistics for that player not being kept.  Each game on the Game Menu screen provides an educational game in a particular foreign language.  A separate Help is provided for each game.
