<h3>Game Rules</h3>
A Sentence Fill-In-The-Blank (SFIB) game presents a sentence to a player with a single word missing which is denoted by _. for each letter of the blanked word.  For example, the following sentence shows a blanked word of six characters:
<br><br>
<b>Il est maintenant temps pour tous les bons _._._._._._ à venir à l'aide de leur pays.</b>
<br><br>
A player must use the virtual keyboard to enter the appropriate letters with correct capitalization (for words that begin a sentence or proper nouns), punctuation (including end of sentence punctuation), and language-specific special characters.  Special characters are accessed by holding one's finger on a particular letter which will bring up a menu of special characters for that letter.  The player must slide their finger to select the appropriate special character to insert it into the game text view.
<br><br>
A player achieves the most points by entering the correct word without ever pressing the hint button.  The first press of Hint will reveal the English version of the sentence.  Subsequent presses of Hint will reveal the leftmost letter of the word that has not yet been revealed.  Players are awarded points based on the perceived difficulty of the word (how long it is, how many special characters), how many letters they entered, and how many hints they took.
